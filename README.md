<b>Project Description:</b><br>

The "USA Wildfire Explorer" map offers an immersive and interactive experience for exploring and analyzing historical wildfire data across the United States from the years 2000 to 2018. Leveraging the power of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript, this project integrates advanced mapping functionalities, dynamic rendering, and user-friendly search and query features.

<b>Key Features:</b>

1. Dynamic 3D Visualization: Utilizing a SceneView, the project presents a dynamic and visually engaging 3D representation of wildfire incidents, allowing users to explore the landscape from different perspectives.

2. Interactive Home Button: The addition of a Home button provides users with a convenient way to reset the view to its initial position, ensuring a seamless navigation experience.

3. Class Breaks Renderer: A sophisticated Class Breaks Renderer categorizes wildfires based on their size in acres, employing a color-coded representation for better visualization and understanding.

4. Informative Popup Templates: Popup templates provide detailed information about each wildfire incident, including the incident name, state, fire year, acres burned, and the responsible land agency.

5. Layer List with Legend: The Layer List widget offers an organized view of available layers, enhanced with a legend to assist users in interpreting the color-coded representation of wildfire sizes.

6. Search and Query Functionality: Users are prompted to enter a specific fire year between 2000 and 2018. The application dynamically filters and displays wildfires for the chosen year, providing an insightful exploration of historical fire incidents.

7. Results Display and Spatial Query: The project includes a spatial query feature that dynamically updates the map extent and displays the count of wildfires for the selected year. The results are presented in a user-friendly manner, enhancing the overall experience.

8. List View of Wildfires: A list view is implemented to display wildfire incidents as interactive list items. Users can click on a specific wildfire in the list to view additional details through the popup.

9. Enhanced User Interface: The user interface is carefully designed, with widgets strategically placed for easy navigation. The integration of search, legend, and query functionalities contributes to an intuitive and informative user experience.

10. Detailed Graphics and Feature Selection: The project efficiently manages graphics, allowing users to click on a wildfire in the list to open an informative popup, providing a detailed overview of the selected incident.

Explore the "USA Wildfire Explorer" to gain valuable insights into historical wildfire patterns, sizes, and locations, fostering a deeper understanding of the impact of wildfires across the United States.
